## blank lines are intentional, as they need

## test a 'normal' case
Paris is a beautiful city.

## test blankspace (' ', '\t')
Mason   doesn't like     extra  spaces

## test continuation
Lines with a continuation \
should be concatenated together.

## test inline comments
This line should end here # because of this comment
Lines with a "#" should still be included.

## test false continuation in comment
# this line should not be continued as a comment \
I am glad this line is still included.
