# Style Guide for CRASH

## Prints
- State the file name in brackets of where the print was ran
  - Ex: [SET]: Debug mode enabled
- If needed state either error, warn or debug in brackets after
  - Ex: [SHELL][DEBUG]: External Path: /usr/bin/ls
- These are not needed for normal command output, but should be used for status type prints
